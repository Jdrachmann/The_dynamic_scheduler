1. Use movement patterns instead of exercises to decrease solution space
2. Add general fatigue/CNS fatigue as a parameter to optimize on
3. Change algorithm to also adjust individuals differently. Could be trying to switch around workout days.
4. When only x days avaliable, decrease the indivdual creation to only include mutation on x days that can be used for working out
5. Add feature that includes number of days you want to workout and not only avaliablility.
6. Make optimization handle musclegroups such as calfs and side delts manually. They general impact on the scheduling is basically 0 and only increases solution space
